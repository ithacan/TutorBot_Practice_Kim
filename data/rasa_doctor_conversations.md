J:  Don't worry. You can buy travel insurance which covers medical expenses for illness or accident.
T:  Oh, that's good. Where can I buy it?
J:  You can buy it online or at the airport. But remember that you should buy it before your travel actually begins.
T:  I see. Do you know how much it would cost?
J:  It depends on the duration of your stay.
T:  Aha, so having health insurance is important and it makes me feel a bit secure.
J:  That's right. Buy one that has a good coverage.
T:  Oh, I will. Thank you Jo for your advice.
J:  No problem. Have a nice journey.
